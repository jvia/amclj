# amclj

AMCL in Clojure.

This project implements the amcl algorithm from Probabilistic Robotics in Clojure for the ROS middleware. Buried inside includes a means to communicate with the ROS middleware by wrapping rosjava.

Due to being a first stab at message (de)serialization, there is unecessary overhead making it a bi slow for this purpose. But if you're patient, the algorithm works as expected.
